    <h1>CMB Sonification</h1>
    <p>This is the conification of the CMB. <strong>Please ensure your audio is on and interact 
with the image to hear the sound.</strong><br> The image is a 3000x3000 rendering of the Planck 2013 CMB data. 
You can use the zoom out function of the browser to see the full image.<br>The running dot that can be hard to follow, 
is iterating every pixel of the image,<br>and reads the RGB values of the pixels, taking only red and blue values 
in a range from 0 to 255.<br>The project is ongoing.</p>
